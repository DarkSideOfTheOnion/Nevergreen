# Nevergreen
The year is 5276, the universe's commerce is a monopoly controlled by the Baldus overlord Ness Nezzos.
In a filthy galaxy 5 million light years from the Krotus system, a small delivery company tries to survive. The Tristies are at war with the Baldus, the Houng with the Dong, North Mory with South Mory and the Humans From Earth with, well... everyone...

The sky is cloudy and with a toxic orange tint, a thick layer of dust and smoke fills the air outside, no nature to be seen, just vast deserts spotted with dense and highly industrial cities. Located in the outskirts of the Kalmero Oasis on Xenia VI, somewhat hidden in the sand and space trash, is the Nevergreen Ltd.'s hangar.
